The Researcher's Quest: A browser-based RPG tool turning literary research design (Problem-Theory-Methodology-Methods) into a narrative quest. Features: 6 Hero roles, XP tracking, and coherence logic for classroom learning. Learn research by playing!eal for immediate classroom deployment and local use.
The Researcher's Quest: A Research Design RPG Tool
This repository hosts The Researcher's Quest, an interactive, browser-based tool designed to teach the fundamentals of academic research design through the lens of a Role-Playing Game (RPG). It transforms the abstract process of drafting a research proposal into a sequential narrative adventure, making complex methodological decisions concrete and engaging.

Project Overview
This tool guides users—referred to as the "Hero"—through the necessary steps of academic inquiry, ensuring methodological coherence and logical alignment from start to finish.

The core research pathway is presented as an adventure map:

Prelude & Boon Selection: Choosing an innate Researcher Class (e.g., Theorist, Analyst) that grants unique, strategic advantages.

ACT I: The Mission: Defining the "Final Boss" (the Research Problem) and using Problem Keywords to build a conceptual compass.

ACT II: Strategy: Navigating the Theory Forest and crossing the Methodology Bridge to select the correct intellectual framework and high-level strategy.

ACT III: Execution: Forging the necessary Methods (Tools/Weapons) in the dungeon, culminating in the Boss Battle (Proposal Defense and Peer Challenge).

Key Features
Narrative Framing: Each step of the research process is introduced by an engaging narrative sequence, setting the scene for the decision ahead.

Role Integration: Six distinct Researcher Classes provide unique, mechanical "Boons" (e.g., the Theorist can select three theories; the Analyst can select four methods).

Coherence Enforcement: Built-in JavaScript logic enforces critical limits (e.g., maximum number of theories/methods) and guides users toward consistency.

XP Tracking: Includes a detailed rubric for awarding Experience Points (XP) based on alignment, justification, and successful defense, culminating in a final academic rank (e.g., "Master Researcher").

Pure HTML/JS: The tool is fully client-side and requires no server or database, making it ideal for immediate classroom deployment and local use.
